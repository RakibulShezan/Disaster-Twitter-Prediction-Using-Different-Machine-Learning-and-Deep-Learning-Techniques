# Disaster-Twitter-Prediction-Using-Different-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Techniques
Twitter has become one of the most frequently used media for both communication and getting daily information. Tweets can be a useful medium for everyone to be alert when a disaster occurs on a place. So, in this paper we used some state of the art machine learning and deep learning techniques with information retrieval technique to create models that can be used to classify disaster tweets from random tweets. We used a labeled tweeter dataset with 7613 disaster and random tweets. Logistic Regression with TF-IDF technique gave us the best result as itâ€™s accuracy was 80% in the dataset. The other techniques that we used were Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Long Short Term Memory(LSTM).
